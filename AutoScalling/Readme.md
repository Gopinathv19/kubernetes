## README: Kubernetes Autoscaling

### Introduction
Kubernetes Autoscaling is a powerful mechanism to automatically adjust the number of replicas of a deployment based on resource utilization. This ensures optimal resource utilization and cost-efficiency while maintaining application performance.

### Prerequisites
* A Kubernetes cluster
* `kubectl` command-line tool

### Deployment
1. **Create a Deployment:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   This creates a Deployment named `php-apache`.

2. **Verify Deployment:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get svc
   ```
   Ensure the pods and service are running correctly.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
An HPA automatically scales the number of replicas based on CPU utilization or other metrics.

1. **Create an HPA:**
   ```bash
   kubectl autoscale deploy php-apache --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
   ```
   This creates an HPA for the `php-apache` deployment with a target CPU utilization of 50%, a minimum of 1 replica, and a maximum of 10 replicas.

2. **View HPA:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa
   ```

### Load Testing and HPA Behavior
To simulate increased load and observe HPA behavior:

1. **Start Load Generator:**
   ```bash
   kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=Never -- /bin/sh -c "while sleep 0.01; do wget -q -O- http://php-apache; done"
   ```
   This starts a load generator that continuously sends requests to the `php-apache` service.

2. **Monitor HPA:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa --watch
   ```
   This displays the HPA status and updates as the load increases and decreases.

### Explanation
* **Deployment:** Defines the desired state of your application, including the number of replicas.
* **HPA:** Monitors CPU utilization and automatically adjusts the number of replicas to match demand.
* **Load Generator:** Simulates increased traffic to test the HPA's response.

By combining these components, you can effectively manage the scaling of your application based on its workload.

### Additional Notes
* Adjust `cpu-percent`, `min`, and `max` values based on your application's requirements.
* Consider using other metrics (e.g., memory, custom metrics) for more complex scaling scenarios.
* Explore advanced HPA features like stabilization window and target utilization.
* Implement proper monitoring and alerting to track HPA performance.

**Remember to replace `php-apache` with the actual name of your deployment.**

By following these steps and understanding the concepts, you can efficiently manage your Kubernetes workloads and optimize resource utilization.
